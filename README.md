# unit-4-game

Welcome! This game is called Crystals Collector. You will see a number called computer choice. This is the number you are trying to reach but not exceed with the four unique crystals you see in front of you. Each crystal is worth a different number and you win when the total reaches the number the computer picked. No two games are alike. Best of luck!
